It uses the yield keyword to produce values one at a time, suspending its execution and preserving its internal state between each yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield keyword is used within a generator function to define points at which the function should pause its execution and yield a value. When the generator is iterated over, each yield statement produces a value that can be consumed or processed by the caller. The function's state is then saved, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off when the next value is requested.\n",

This is especially useful when dealing with large data sets or infinite sequences where generating and storing all values in memory at once would be impractical or memory-intensive.\n",

Each time the yield statement is encountered, it returns the current value of num and suspends its execution. When the generator is iterated over again, it resumes execution after the yield statement and increments num by 2 to produce the next even number.\n",
