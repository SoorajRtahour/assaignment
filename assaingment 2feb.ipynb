    "Ans. Sure! I'll provide an example for each to illustrate when to use a for loop and when to use a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For Loop:\n",
    "A for loop is useful when you know the number of iterations or when you want to iterate over a sequence of items. Let's say you have a list of numbers and you want to print each number in the list. Here's an example using a for loop in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "In this case, the for loop iterates over the elements in the 'numbers' list, and the variable 'num' takes each value in the list one by one. The loop will execute five times, printing each number on a separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. While Loop:\n",
    "A while loop is suitable when you want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is no longer true. For instance, let's say you want to generate a series of numbers and print them until the sum exceeds a certain threshold. Here's an example using a while loop in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "num = 1\n",
    "threshold = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "while total < threshold:\n",
    "    total += num\n",
    "    print(total)\n",
    "    num += 1\n",
    "In this example, the while loop continues executing as long as the 'total' is less than the 'threshold'. It keeps adding the value of 'num' to 'total' and printing the updated value of 'total' until the condition is no longer true. The loop will stop when total becomes equal to or greater than 'threshold'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, use a for loop when you know the number of iterations or want to iterate over a sequence, and use a while loop when you want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met."
