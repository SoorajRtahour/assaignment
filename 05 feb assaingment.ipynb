    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (behavior) together within a class. It involves hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface to interact with the object. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, security, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of the base class, which can be further extended or overridden as needed. Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (redefining a method in a derived class) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves the representation of essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It focuses on defining the interface or behavior of an object without exposing the internal implementation. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, enhancing modularity, and providing a high-level view of objects and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP provide principles and concepts to design and develop modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems. They promote code organization, flexibility, and code reuse, making it easier to manage and scale complex projects."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self parameter is used as a convention to refer to the instance of a class within its own methods. It acts as a reference to the current object being accessed or manipulated.\n",

    "Calling other methods: self is used to call other methods of the same class. By using self.method_name(), you can invoke other methods within the class and perform certain actions or computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying instance attributes: With self, you can modify the values of instance attributes within the methods. This enables you to update the state of the object as needed during the execution of the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating instance attributes from local variables: self helps distinguish between instance attributes and local variables within the methods. By using self.attribute_name, you indicate that you are referring to the instance attribute and not a local variable defined within the method.\n",
